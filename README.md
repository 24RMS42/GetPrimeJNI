# GetPrimeJNI
This app shows simple usage of JNI

## Technology stack used

* Java
* C++

## How it works

* The app allows the user to input two integer numbers in the range 1 â€“ 1000
*	The app calculates and outputs/prints the prime numbers in the range between the two integer numbers supplied by the user. 
  The prime numbers are returned in a randomized order.
*	Data entry and output was written in Java.
*	The computation of prime numbers and randomization was completed in C++ and integrated with the Java front-end.

Example: the user enters 275 and 300 and the app returns 281, 293, 283, 277 or any other permutation of these four numbers.
